During the work of my Master's Thesis I have had to become familiar with data analysis tools like Python or Excel VBA. 
These codes, made with the help of the online community and ChatGPT as a tool to check for errors, have been made by me to run the analysis of the data needed to obtain results for the thesis
I am offering these codes to the scientific community with the intention of aiding those to whom they may be useful. There is no need for citation or mention anywhere
I hope they can be useful in your pursuit of knowledge. Per Aspera ad Astra. Take care
